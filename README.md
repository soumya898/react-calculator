# React Calculator with useState Hook

This project is a simple React calculator that employs the useState hook for managing state. The calculator allows users to input two numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations while providing input validation and feedback messages.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a functional React calculator utilizing the useState hook for state management. The calculator performs arithmetic operations on user inputs, handles validation, and displays error and success messages accordingly.

## Task

1. Input two numbers as text fields.
2. Implement buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Perform validation on input fields (non-empty, numeric, positive/negative).
4. Display error messages in red if validation fails.
5. Execute arithmetic operations and display results.
6. Show success messages with the outcome.
7. Ensure proper UI alignment and color usage.
